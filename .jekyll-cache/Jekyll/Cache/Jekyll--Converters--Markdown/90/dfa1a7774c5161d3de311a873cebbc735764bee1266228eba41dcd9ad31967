I"Ø<p>Using advance analytics, our team offered business 
insights. So our stakeholders could take the best data driven descisions.
Our team achieved this by creating machine learning models, using inside and outside data sources. 
Also, by developing analytical products (API, WebApps, Dashboards) that bring value to the Middle Americas Zone (14 countries).
On the innovation front, the team raised business necesities and pain points. 
With those in hand, we acted as Tinder and match the necesities with a scale up that could solve them. 
If the test pilot results were beyond the expectations, the business invested in the scale up.</p>
